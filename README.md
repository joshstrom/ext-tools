# README #

Do you hate having to remember or type long branch names (e.g.: feature/PROJ-1345-some-feature-i-really-need-to-implement)? Welcome to ext-tools! 

The purpose of this project is to remove, as much as possible, the need to manually type or copy/paste long branch names when doing things like:
* Checking out branches.
* Diffing branches.
* Pulling remote branches.
